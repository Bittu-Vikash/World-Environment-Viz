# 📊 World Environment Data Cleaning and Visualization Project

## 🗂️ Project Overview
This project focuses on **data cleaning, transformation, and visualization** using a dataset obtained from Kaggle.com.  
The raw data was processed and reshaped using **Python** and its data manipulation libraries, followed by **visual analysis and storytelling** through **Tableau**.

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (for data cleaning and reshaping)
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Tableau** (for visualization and dashboard creation)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for code execution and exploration)

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation Process
1. **Data Loading:** Imported the dataset from Kaggle into a Jupyter environment.  
2. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Corrected inconsistent entries  
   - Standardized categorical and numerical data  
3. **Data Transformation:**  
   - Reshaped the dataset for analysis (using melt/pivot operations)  
   - Created calculated columns for better insights  
4. **Visualization:**  
   - Designed interactive dashboards in Tableau to uncover patterns and trends
